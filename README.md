# Tools for Assist _(Custom Integration for Home Assistant)_

Forked and modified from the original [Tools For Assist](https://github.com/skye-harris/llm_intents) to include a local SearXNG metasearch option. Also made some tweaks to the Weather.py file.

This is a work in progress and may contain bugs. I will always try to update from upstream but wanted something that would add tools not locked behind a paywall or require configuring APIs before you can use them.

Additional tools for LLM-backed Assist for Home Assistant:

* **Brave Web Search**
* **SearXNG Web Search**
* **Google Places**
* **Wikipedia**
* **Weather Forecast**

Each tool is optional and configurable via the integrations UI. Some tools require API keys, but are usable on free tiers.
A caching layer is utilised in order to reduce both API usage and latency on repeated requests for the same information within a 2-hour period.

## Installation

### Install via HACS (recommended)

Have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed, this will allow you to update easily.

* Adding Tools for Assist to HACS can be using this button - note, this is a link to the skye-harris version. I have not pushed this to HACS. I didn't want to cause confusion or make anyone think I created this tool. I'm standing on the shoulders of people much greater than I. The rest of this document is from the original repo:

> [!NOTE]
> If the button above doesn't work, add `https://github.com/skye-harris/llm_intents` as a custom repository of type Integration in HACS.

* Click install on the `Tools for Assist` integration.

## Integration Configuration

After installation, configure the integration through Home Assistant's UI:

1. Go to `Settings` → `Devices & Services`.
2. Click `Add Integration`.
3. Search for `Tools for Assist`.
4. Follow the setup wizard to configure your desired services.

## Conversation Agent Configuration

Once the integration is installed and configured, you will need to enable the desired services within your Conversation Agent entities.

For the Ollama and OpenAI Conversation integrations, this can be found within your Conversation Agent configuration options, beneath
the `Control Home Assistant` heading, and enabling the services desired for the Agent:

- Search Services

### ⛅ Weather Forecast

Rather than accessing the internet directly for weather information, this tool utilises your existing Home Assistant weather integration and makes the forecast data accessible to your LLM in an intelligent manner.

At a minimum, this tool requires a weather entity that provides daily forecast data.
It is recommended, though optional, to also specify a weather entity that provides hourly weather data.

For cases where a specific days weather is requested (eg: `today`, `tomorrow`, `wednesday`), the hourly data will be provided if available.
If data for the week is requested, no hourly forecast entity is set, or the hourly forecast does not contain data for the requested day, the daily weather data will be used instead.

#### Requirements

* An existing weather forecast integration configured within Home Assistant.

#### Configuration Steps

1. Select "Weather Forecast" during setup.
2. Select the weather entity that provides daily forecast information.
3. Optionally, select the weather entity that provides hourly forecast information.

### Options

| Setting                 | Required | Description                                                |
|-------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Daily Weather Entity`  | ✅        | The weather entity to use for daily weather forecast data  |
| `Hourly Weather Entity` | ❌        | The weather entity to use for hourly weather forecast data |
